# scan-react-css

`scan-react-css` audits how React source code uses CSS.

It scans React source files, project CSS, and CSS Modules, then reports deterministic findings for local development and CI. The current package is the rebooted product shell around the static analysis engine in `src/static-analysis-engine`.

## Current Status

The active public contract is documented in:

- [Reboot Contract](./docs/design/reboot-contract.md)
- [Rules Catalogue](./docs/design/rules-catalogue.md)
- [CSS Modules Contract](./docs/design/css-modules-contract.md)
- [Current Product Assessment](./docs/design/current-product-assessment.md)

Some historical scanner features are being reintroduced deliberately. Unsupported historical flags fail fast instead of being ignored.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev scan-react-css
```

Node `20+` is required.

For one-off runs:

```bash
npx scan-react-css
```

## Quick Start

Scan the current directory:

```bash
npx scan-react-css
```

Scan a specific project root:

```bash
npx scan-react-css ./packages/web
```

Focus reported findings on a subtree while still analyzing the full project context:

```bash
npx scan-react-css ./packages/web --focus src/features/payments
```

Write a JSON report file:

```bash
npx scan-react-css --json
```

By default this creates `scan-react-css-reports/scan-react-css-output.json`, or the next available
suffixed path if that file already exists.

## CLI Usage

```bash
scan-react-css [rootDir] [--config path] [--focus path-or-glob] [--json] [--output-file path] [--overwrite-output]
```

Supported flags:

- `--config path/to/scan-react-css.json`
- `--focus path-or-glob`
- `--json`
- `--output-file path/to/report.json`
- `--overwrite-output`
- `--help`

`rootDir` must be a directory. File paths and missing paths fail with a clear diagnostic.

### Focused Output

`--focus` is an output filter, not a smaller analysis root. The scanner still loads and analyzes the full project root so imports, global CSS, render relationships, and reachability context remain available.

Details:

- `--focus` can be provided more than once.
- A focus value can contain comma-separated paths.
- Non-glob values match an exact file or directory subtree.
- Glob values use project-relative `/` paths and support `*`, `?`, and `**`.
- Source, CSS, class-reference, class-definition, and selector-query counts describe the full project context.
- Finding counts and the CLI exit code are based on the focused findings.
- Error diagnostics are not hidden by focus.

Examples:

```bash
npx scan-react-css --focus src/components
npx scan-react-css --focus src/components,src/pages
npx scan-react-css --focus "src/features/**/components"
```

### Current Unsupported Flags

These historical flags are recognized but not supported in this build yet:

- `--print-config`
- `--verbosity`
- `--output-min-severity`

`--output-file` and `--overwrite-output` require `--json`.

Interactive text-mode scans print the active scan stage to `stderr` while analysis is running, for
example `Building reachability graph`. JSON mode keeps progress output disabled so automation sees
only the report confirmation on stdout.

### JSON Reports

`--json` writes a deterministic JSON report to a file and prints a short confirmation to stdout.
It does not dump the JSON payload to the terminal.

Default behavior:

- writes to `scan-react-css-reports/scan-react-css-output.json`
- preserves existing reports by writing `scan-react-css-output-1.json`, then `-2`, in that reports directory
- exits non-zero after writing the report if the scan failed

Custom output:

```bash
npx scan-react-css --json --output-file ./reports/scan-react-css.json
npx scan-react-css --json --output-file ./reports/scan-react-css.json --overwrite-output
```

## Config

The config file is JSON and defaults to `scan-react-css.json`.

CLI discovery order:

1. explicit `--config`, resolved from the directory where the command is run
2. `scan-react-css.json` in the directory where the command is run
3. `SCAN_REACT_CSS_CONFIG_DIR/scan-react-css.json`
4. first `scan-react-css.json` found on the OS `PATH`
5. built-in defaults

The Node API uses `configBaseDir` for explicit `configPath` resolution and project config discovery.
If `configBaseDir` is omitted, it defaults to `rootDir`.

Only one config source is loaded. There is no config merging.
Unknown config keys and unknown rule IDs are errors. Legacy scanner keys such as `css`, `source`,
and `classComposition` must be removed or migrated before the scan can pass.

Current config shape:

```json
{
  "failOnSeverity": "error",
  "rules": {
    "unused-css-class": "warn",
    "dynamic-class-reference": "info",
    "unsupported-syntax-affecting-analysis": "off"
  },
  "cssModules": {
    "localsConvention": "camelCase"
  },
  "externalCss": {
    "fetchRemote": false,
    "remoteTimeoutMs": 5000,
    "globals": [
      {
        "provider": "custom-icons",
        "match": ["**/custom-icons.css"],
        "classPrefixes": ["ci-"],
        "classNames": ["ci"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`failOnSeverity` accepts `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`.

Rule values accept `off`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`.

CSS Module `localsConvention` accepts:

- `asIs`
- `camelCase`
- `camelCaseOnly`

External CSS config controls provider declarations and optional remote fetching. Built-in defaults
include Font Awesome, Material Design Icons, Bootstrap Icons, Animate.css, UIkit, and Pure.css
provider declarations; custom `externalCss.globals` entries are appended to those defaults. Static
HTML/CDN stylesheet links activate matching declared providers, so a Font Awesome CDN link can
satisfy `fa-*` references without an HTTP fetch. Local HTML-linked `.css` files are loaded, parsed,
and treated as project-wide reachable. JavaScript and TypeScript package CSS imports such as
`import "bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css"` are resolved under `node_modules`, loaded,
parsed, and treated as external imports. Provider declarations are only activated by configured
external stylesheet evidence such as HTML/CDN links, not by package CSS imports. Package CSS loaded
through CSS `@import` is also resolved under `node_modules`, parsed, and treated as reachable through
the importing stylesheet. Package CSS resolution searches upward from the scan root for the nearest
usable `node_modules` directory, so subdirectory scans can still resolve workspace-level packages.
Remote stylesheet links are fetched only when `externalCss.fetchRemote` is `true`; fetched CSS is
parsed into concrete classes, uses `remoteTimeoutMs`, and fetch failures are reported as warning
diagnostics. Default scans perform no network requests.

## Rules

Default rules:

- `missing-css-class` defaults to `error`
- `css-class-unreachable` defaults to `error`
- `unused-css-class` defaults to `warn`
- `missing-css-module-class` defaults to `error`
- `unused-css-module-class` defaults to `warn`
- `unsatisfiable-selector` defaults to `warn`
- `compound-selector-never-matched` defaults to `warn`
- `unused-compound-selector-branch` defaults to `warn`
- `single-component-style-not-colocated` defaults to `info`
- `style-used-outside-owner` defaults to `warn`
- `style-shared-without-shared-owner` defaults to `info`
- `dynamic-class-reference` defaults to `info`
- `unsupported-syntax-affecting-analysis` defaults to `debug`

Findings carry both severity and confidence. Debug findings are hidden from CLI output.

## Node API

```ts
import { scanProject } from "scan-react-css";

const result = await scanProject({
  rootDir: process.cwd(),
  configPath: "scan-react-css.json",
});

console.log(result.summary);
console.log(result.findings);
```

`scanProject()` accepts:

```ts
type ScanProjectInput = {
  rootDir?: string;
  sourceFilePaths?: string[];
  cssFilePaths?: string[];
  configPath?: string;
  configBaseDir?: string;
  onProgress?: (event: ScanProgressEvent) => void;
};
```

`onProgress` receives `{ stage, status, message }` events while project loading, engine analysis,
and rule execution run. It is optional and does not change scan results.

The result contains:

- `rootDir`
- `config`
- `diagnostics`
- `findings`
- `summary`
- `failed`
- discovered `files`

Raw engine internals are not exposed through the public API result.

## Output And CI

The CLI exits non-zero when:

- an error diagnostic is produced, or
- a finding meets `failOnSeverity`

Default policy:

- `error` findings fail the scan
- `warn`, `info`, and `debug` findings do not

Human-readable output is intended for local use. Findings are grouped by file, separated by blank
lines, and followed by a summary. Finding locations are printed as `path/to/file:line` targets so
VS Code and common terminals can open them directly. Interactive terminals get severity colors,
unless `NO_COLOR` is set.

JSON output is deterministic and intended for tooling and CI.
