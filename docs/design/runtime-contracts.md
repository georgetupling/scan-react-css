# Runtime Contracts

## Purpose

This document defines the main runtime-facing contracts for `react-css-scanner`.

It is the operational companion to:

- [architecture.md](./architecture.md)
- [config-schema.md](./config-schema.md)
- [config-contract.md](./config-contract.md)
- [rules.md](./rules.md)

## Runtime surface areas

The scanner has two primary runtime surfaces:

- CLI
- Node API

Both use the same analysis engine and the same finding model.

## Config resolution contract

### Resolution order

The scanner resolves config in this order:

1. explicit CLI or API config path
2. project-root `react-css-scanner.json`
3. `REACT_CSS_SCANNER_CONFIG_DIR/react-css-scanner.json`
4. first `react-css-scanner.json` found on the OS `PATH`
5. built-in defaults

### Resolution behavior

- Exactly one config source is loaded.
- Config files are not merged.
- If no config file is found, built-in defaults are used.
- If built-in defaults are used because no config file was found, the CLI emits an operational warning.

## CLI contract

### Core command

```bash
react-css-scanner
```

### Supported syntax

```bash
react-css-scanner [targetPath] [--focus path/to/focus] [--config path/to/react-css-scanner.json] [--json] [--output-min-severity warning] [--output-file ./reports/react-css-scanner.json] [--overwrite-output] [--config-summary default] [--output-mode default]
```

### Supported flags

- `--config path/to/react-css-scanner.json`
- `--focus path/to/focus`
- `--json`
- `--output-min-severity info|warning|error`
- `--output-file path/to/report.json`
- `--overwrite-output`
- `--config-summary off|default|verbose`
- `--output-mode minimal|default|verbose`

### CLI behavior

- If `targetPath` is omitted, the scanner uses the current working directory as the project root.
- If `--focus` is provided, the scanner still indexes the full project but only emits findings that touch the focused path.
- If `--config` is provided, it overrides discovery.
- If `--json` is provided, the scanner emits machine-readable JSON.
- Without `--json`, the scanner emits human-readable terminal output.
- `--output-min-severity` filters only human-readable output.
- `--output-file` requires `--json`.
- `--output-min-severity` cannot be used with `--json`.
- If `--output-file` points to an existing file and `--overwrite-output` is not set, the CLI writes to the first available suffixed filename such as `report-1.json`.
- If `--overwrite-output` is provided, the CLI may overwrite the destination file.
- `--config-summary` controls how much config information appears in JSON output.
- `--output-mode` controls how much human-readable detail is printed.

## Node API contract

Current package exports include:

- `scan`
- `scanReactCss`

Current shape:

```ts
type ScanInput = {
  targetPath?: string;
  focusPath?: string;
  configPath?: string;
  config?: RawReactCssScannerConfig;
  cwd?: string;
};

type ScanResult = {
  config: ResolvedReactCssScannerConfig;
  configSource: ResolvedConfigSource;
  operationalWarnings: string[];
  findings: Finding[];
  summary: ScanSummary;
};
```

## Finding contract

Core finding shape:

```ts
type Finding = {
  ruleId: string;
  family: string;
  severity: "info" | "warning" | "error";
  confidence: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  message: string;
  primaryLocation?: FindingLocation;
  relatedLocations: FindingLocation[];
  subject?: FindingSubject;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

Location shape:

```ts
type FindingLocation = {
  filePath: string;
  line?: number;
  column?: number;
  context?: string;
};
```

Subject shape:

```ts
type FindingSubject = {
  className?: string;
  cssFilePath?: string;
  sourceFilePath?: string;
};
```

## Severity and confidence

Finding severity:

- `info`
- `warning`
- `error`

Config-only severity:

- `off`

Confidence:

- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`

Severity and confidence are separate.

## Exit-code contract

- `0` when no configured policy threshold is breached
- non-zero when configured policy thresholds are breached
- non-zero for operational failures such as invalid config, invalid CLI arguments, unreadable explicit paths, or fatal runtime errors

With default config, `error` findings fail the scan. `warning` and `info` do not.

Output filtering does not change policy evaluation.

## Human-readable output contract

The human-readable output includes:

- scan target
- config source used
- summary counts
- findings in a stable order

Default ordering is:

1. severity
2. confidence
3. subject key such as class name
4. file path

Human-readable output modes:

- `minimal`
- `default`
- `verbose`

## JSON output contract

JSON output is deterministic and structured.

Config summary modes:

- `off`
- `default`
- `verbose`

`--output-min-severity` does not affect JSON output. JSON always includes the full unfiltered result for the run.

When present, `operationalWarnings` are also included in JSON output.

## Determinism contract

For the same file tree, config, and CLI options, the scanner should produce:

- the same findings
- the same summary
- the same exit-code behavior
- stable output ordering

## Operational warnings

Warnings that are not findings should be used sparingly.

The main expected operational warning is:

- no config file discovered, built-in defaults used

## External CSS behavior

- Imported external CSS from source files is modeled when it is discoverable from the project import graph.
- HTML files under the scan root are inspected for stylesheet links.
- In the default `declared-globals` mode, matching HTML-linked provider presets such as Font Awesome can satisfy known external class families without network fetches.
- In `fetch-remote` mode, remote HTML-linked stylesheet URLs are fetched directly for the current scan and failures degrade to operational warnings plus fallback external-css behavior.
